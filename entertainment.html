    <h3>Entertainment</h3>
    <p>
      Most people visit Taniti to enjoy the beaches, explore the rainforest, and to visit the volcano. <br><br>
      However, there are other things to do, including visiting a local history museum, going on chartered fishing tours, 
      snorkeling, zip-lining in the rainforest, visiting several pubs, including a microbrewery, dancing at a new dance club, 
      seeing a movie, taking helicopter rides, playing at an arcade, visiting art galleries, and bowling. <br><br>
      Also, a nine-hole golf course should be operational by next year. <br><br>
      Many of these activities are located in Merriton Landing, which is a rapidly developing area on the north side of Yellow Leaf Bay. 
    </p>
    <h3>Sight Seeing</h3>
    <p>
      Most tourists spend most of their time in Taniti City, which boasts native architecture and nearby white, sandy beaches that encircle Yellow Leaf Bay. <br><br>
      Other popular activities include boat or bus tours of the island, hikes in the rainforest, or visits to Taniti's active volcano.
